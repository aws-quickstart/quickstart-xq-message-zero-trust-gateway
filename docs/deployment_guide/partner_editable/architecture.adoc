Deploying this Partner Solution with default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/xq-message-zero-trust-gateway-arch-diag.png[Architecture, 80%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An Auto Scaling group to restart the XQ Gateway software in a secondary Availability Zone if needed.
* In the public subnets:
** An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance running XQ Gateway software.
** An Elastic IP address to provide a reserved public IP address to assign to the EC2 instance.
** An AWS Transfer Family server to provide an SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) interface to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.
* An S3 bucket to store data that XQ Gateway has transferred in.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

//TODO Shivansh, Is the Elastic IP address critical to understanding this architecture? If not, let's leave it out. We usually don't show it. (If it is helpful to show it, does it belong inside the subnet in the diagram? We list it that way.)
