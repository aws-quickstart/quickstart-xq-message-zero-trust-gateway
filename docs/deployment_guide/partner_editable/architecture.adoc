image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/xq-message-zero-trust-gateway-arch-diag.png[Architecture, 80%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance running {partner-product-short-name} software. 
** An Auto Scaling group that automatically scales the number of instances to meet demand and, if needed, restarts the {partner-product-short-name} software in a secondary Availability Zone.
** An Elastic IP address to provide a reserved public IP address to assign to the EC2 instance.
** An AWS Transfer Family server to provide an SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) interface to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.
* An S3 bucket to store data that {partner-product-short-name} has transferred in.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
